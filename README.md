Template for building out experiments with Dapps/testing new libraries

Simplified template for Dapps- routing is implemented and single page style is already implemented in case you want to build it out more. Add more components and link them to the navbar at your convenience. 

Wallet connect to Ethers.js allows you to access a provider, account, account balance easily- useContext passes info down to nested child components as needed.
